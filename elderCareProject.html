    <h1>UX in Elder Care Support System</h1>
    <p>Performing user and task analysis including persona definition and feature prioritisation for an elder care support system</p>
  </header>
  <section class="majorContents">
    <p>This project is intended to analyze the insights on the creation of an elder care support system from scratch. The information analysis enables to
      <ul class="nestedList1">
        <li>Better understand the user’s goals</li>
        <li>Better understand the user’s goals</li>
        <li>Work that support these goals</li>
        <li>Task structure</li>
        <li>Task flexibility</li>
        <li>Information requirements</li>
        <li>Language support</li>
        <li>The role of the user</li>
        <li>Work that can be automated through system design</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>User Analysis</h3>
    <p>The user and task analysis strives to improve human productivity, enhance product loyalty, reduce errors, shorten learning requirements, reduce mental workload and enhance the quality of the user/customer experience. When this analysis is properly executed, overall system complexity is generally reduced.</p>
    <p>User abilities will be limited esp ability of elderly. So it is necessary to design by critical thinking considering all possibilities in detail. For elder care support system, the major stakeholders/user profiles would be :
      <ol class="nestedList1">
        <li>Elderly</li>
        <li>Agency</li>
        <li>Elderly Facing Healthcare Person / Home health aide / care coordinator</li>
        <li>3rd-Party service provider <abbr title="Point Of Contact">POC</abbr></li>
        <li>Family <abbr title="Point Of Contact">POC</abbr></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h4><u>Application Requirements</u></h4>

  <h4><u>Task Value Matrix</u></h4>
  <p>The task-value matrix is plotted to identify and negotiate conflicts across profiles, inform trade-offs, and to separate universal requirements from profile-specific requirements. It is also aimed to satisfy the requirements of the most “needy users” while supporting the needs of the more capable, motivated users by connecting the value of task attached to each profile and their expertise.</p>

    <h4><u>Requirements Table</u></h4>
    <p>The above task analysis is a user centric approach designed across the user profile – care coordinator helps to align the business goals, user goals, task requirements and its value proposition in a more understandable way ensuring that the application covers all the required functionalities and makes it usable for the users.</p>

    <h4><u>Data to Design</u></h4>
    <p>Based on the requirements table, the features are prioritized and the information architecture is sketched. Then multiple paper prototypes are designed out of which the most apt design is chosen which is then converted into low fidelity protoypes. User testing could be performed on this low fidelity prototype to confirm the design.</p>
    <p>Once the low fidelity protoypes are tested and iterated for modifications, if needed, based on the test result, the final design is confirmed, after which the high fidelity prototypes are designed which are then handed over to the developement team for its build.</p>
